This folder is where I will be sharing some of my greatest Python accomplishments. The SharePoint 2016 files should be good enough show my skill being that it involves
everything from JSON, HTTP, Request methods, CSV, List, and data processing.

I will continue to add to this repository when major events in this language occur. I will probably not share basics you can find in other repositories. My goal is to
keep my files unique.
